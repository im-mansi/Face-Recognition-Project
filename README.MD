# Face-Recognition-Project


Hello Everyone I am Mansi,
Here I have explained the working of this project:-

1. I have created this application in Python as well as used PHP for web application.

2. Students will able to register on web based application

4. After successful registration their details will be saved in mySQL database and image would be sent for processing.

4. We will have to execute our python script in open CV once which triggers the camera and identifies the registered students.

5. Students would be able to able to mark thier in and out attandance once machine identifies their faces.

6. Presence record would natively be saved in CSV file from where it has been fetched with PHP to show on the web page.

7. After login into the web application students  can see thier own records while admin can see all students in and out timing as well as admin can see presence for any particular day.

8. Install Xampp in your computer as it uses mysql database and PHP lang for Web based application.

9. Create the virtual Envirnoment or Use Existing one in C/XAMPP/HTDOCS folder and open this project, Make sure all the Libraries are setup propery.

10. Thank You.
